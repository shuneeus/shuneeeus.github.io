# Sebasti√°n Huneeus MSc, PhD(c)

Welcome to my Github portfolio. This is a repository on some of the projects I've worked as a freelance data analyst or as a PhD student in the last twelve months. 

I currently live in Berlin and I'm a data analyst intern at [Codept](https://www.codept.de/), a logistics software startup. 

Here you can access my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GlWFI0N9Y_uBQhdjFIcDNmcs6M42GmXiEfqCHUyovOw/edit?usp=sharing) and  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-huneeus)
